# SurAuOmpA
Structural models of SurA in complex with OmpA
These models are included in a publication currently under review. They were built using input from pAF crosslinking, DSBU crosslinking and small angle neutron scattering. 
The pAF crosslinking data are supplementary tables in the publication.
The DSBU crosslinking data are supplementary Excel files included in the publication.
The Igor files containing the SANS data will be deposited here upon publication.
