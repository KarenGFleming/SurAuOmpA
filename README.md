unfolded outer membrane proteins" PNAS In Press.

## The directory contains
1. SANS Data, SASSIE files and related information are included in an Igor Pro file.
2. Structural models of SurA in complex with OmpA that were created. 
3. Raw gels, densitometry values

## The publication itself contains:
1. The pAF crosslinking efficiencies are in supplementary tables in the publication.
2. The DSBU crosslinking data are supplementary Excel files included in the publication.

## Data in other public servers online:
1. All raw and analyzed mass spectra are available on ProteomeXchange under identifiers PXD021870 and PXD021872

## Hydrodynamic analysis of models was conducted using HullRad
